# Fake News Detector using Python

## Project Overview

This project aims to create a simple yet effective Fake News Detector using Python. The detector utilizes natural language processing techniques to analyze and classify news articles as either real or fake. The core functionality is built upon machine learning algorithms, enabling the model to learn from labeled datasets and make predictions on new articles.

## Installation

To run the Fake News Detector, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/fake-news-detector.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd fake-news-detector
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Ensure that you have a labeled dataset for training the model. The dataset should contain two columns: one for the news text and another for the labels (real or fake).

2. Place the dataset in the `data` directory.

3. Run the training script to train the Fake News Detector model:

   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```

   This script will preprocess the data, train the model, and save the trained model to the `models` directory.

4. Once the model is trained, you can use the detector to classify new articles. Modify the `test_article.txt` file in the `data` directory with the text of the article you want to classify.

5. Run the detector script:

   ```bash
   python detect_fake_news.py
   ```

   The script will output the classification result (real or fake) based on the trained model.
